#  "ADBench: A Multi-setting Benchmark Suite for Evaluating Alzheimer’s Disease Diagnostic Models"


This is the official implementation of our conference paper : "ADBench: A Multi-setting Benchmark Suite for Evaluating Alzheimer’s Disease Diagnostic Models".

## Introduction

The paper discusses the importance of correctly diagnosing Alzheimer's disease (AD), which can greatly reduce the burden on society and individuals. Existing AD diagnosis works have limitations as they assume an ideal closed setting where all categories are known prior and the diagnostic strategy is the same for all subjects. To address this limitation, the authors present a multi-setting benchmark suite called ADBench for evaluating AD diagnostic models. ADBench contains ten benchmark datasets covering four clinical settings: a closed setting for classification, a data silos setting for federated learning (FL), an open setting for open set identification, and a real-world setting for implementation. The benchmark suite contains 13 categories of common AD diagnosis data from 67 separate sites and provides a joint simulation of subjects and medical institutions in the real-world setting. The authors evaluate AD diagnostic models in four settings of research and show that the performance of mainstream AD diagnosis models drops sharply in the open and real-world settings. They also provide a quantitative and qualitative analysis of their results, highlighting challenges in the development of AD diagnostic models, and suggest that clinical scale data can improve the robustness of the models. The authors conclude that their benchmark suite can promote the innovation and clinical implementation of AD diagnostic models in different research domains.
